## Project Overview

This project consists of a single-page web application where users can play Tic-Tac-Toe against another player. The game board updates dynamically as players make their moves, and it checks for win conditions or draws after each move. The application is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear game status messages and a restart button for starting a new game.
